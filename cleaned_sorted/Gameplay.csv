Porcupine,253230,Not Recommended,"The full released content / game base grew by a 14MB in the past year , over two major versions ( including all assets , art , music , etc . )",-1
Heil Honkler,219150,Recommended,"gets repetitive eventually , i doubt you'll get more than a couple of thousand hours out of it .",-1
boob,238460,Recommended,you know that monika couldn't have been the only enemy in the game .,-1
finoma,238460,Recommended,"the negatives : + there are a few wobbly mechanics , mostly involving where the tools that you use fall .",-1
Kat,4000,Recommended,99 got me a triple a game that i got about 24 hours of gameplay out of before i got bored of it .,-1
Taorgax,698780,Recommended,"many important mechanics are barely mentioned or not even touched upon ( setting work priorities manually is one such glaring omission ) losing colonists because of mistakes you're aware of or gambles gone wrong is fine , but having them die because you didn't understand a part of the ui is frustrating , and there may be a lot of that if you don't go looking for tips before diving in too deep .",-1
Maelstrom,4000,Recommended,that being said the combat mechanics are just awful .,-1
Riako,294100,Recommended,"the controls are a bit difficult and i often water the wrong plant ( twice ) , which results in them being hyperhydrated and growing slower .",-1
Mumra,698780,Not Recommended,"certainly there are mods available that fix many of my concerns with the current gameplay , but 23 is rather a lot for a title that then requires mods to turn it into something resembling a complete experience .",-1
avaster,219150,Not Recommended,"10 and in general the mechanics can just be buggy , such as prisoner food being left in front of a door and causing a prison break and leaving my colony to die and having to restart , colonists sleeping in the freezer when theres no bed , having me to micromanage even more for no reason , along with a bunch of other small things but very frustrating that i might of forgotten to mention because there are so many things that sometimes get on my nerves and this game litters a bunch of events to cover up a frustrating game , never the less , these all examples of frustrating game mechanics .",-1
OrangeOctopus,698780,Recommended,bad controls .,-1
guganda,253230,Recommended,"hard to get into a multiplayer game , even thou community hub shows thousands of ppl playing ( matchmaking mechanics , i suppose )",-1
Belmont,219740,Recommended,"it's not perfect aside from getting high scores and unlocking all the masks and weapons , there's not a ton of replay value beyond the i haven't played it in awhile or the i wanna see if i can beat it only using x excuses .",-1
charliechuckleberry,4000,Recommended,"alas , you cannot attack the enemy bases ( would be a huge improvement if possible ) .",-1
klippx,219740,Recommended,"it is easy to miss ledges or wires , and overall platforming can be frustrating due to not 100 controls camera is a bit wonky sometimes do i recommend it this game not to hard core gamers , no .",-1
milkshakelake,253230,Recommended,"i wish it were longer and more challenging , though the difficulty is on par with the classics i mentioned .",-1
Mumra,698780,Not Recommended,"the sometimes continual raids that the storyteller throws at you get really tedious to defend , you have to micromanage every unit , which is really jarring next to the normal gameplay which is the antithesis of micromanagement .",-1
Docile Blemmigan,113200,Recommended,"made a few mistakes because the controls can be a little frustrating sometimes ( mainly when farming , the cursor for watering / hoeing sometimes lands where i didn't want it ) .",-1
♥ Onee~Chan ♥,219150,Recommended,"but this is a vns , so i don't expect to have much gameplay anyways : p .",-1
adam,253230,Recommended,"sure , you are going to need to dedicate time to planning your assault on most levels , the enemies don't always follow the same rules : enemies sometimes do not react to gunshots , or can kill you when they are dead , and many other bugs which not only break immersion but are extremely frustrating .",-1
david.king,4000,Recommended,"the game has a few rpg elements , but be warned combat is not a priority .",-1
Cak3N0m,219740,Recommended,"some of the micromanagement is a bit over the top , weeds / stones / trees get out of control quickly if you're not contstantly on top of things .",-1
Exelus,253230,Not Recommended,yay realism but apparently no one considered the gameplay ramifications .,-1
frisbeemenace,253230,Recommended,controls can be a little tricky but its sort of part of the challenge .,-1
Crimson-Albedo,219740,Recommended,there are a few linear levels that slow the gameplay and kill the exploration of 3d platformers that is often enjoyed .,-1
Clauds,4000,Recommended,dungeon crawling and combat feels sloppy and stale in sv compared to rune factory 4 which had bosses and a great story behind it .,-1
Knal1991 - Saint,219150,Recommended,"the most negative thing i can comment on is the fact that only directional keys seem to be changable , this is mostly a bother on a laptop where one often has not a mouse with wheel , and thus miss out on the lock on enemy button .",-1
deSignCN,219740,Recommended,rifle is hard to control .,-1
Fluff-Kevlar,238460,Recommended,"the combat is relatively simple , some information isn't clear on things like range , damage , cover , etc .",-1
Misheru-san,219740,Recommended,"you waste most of you energy fishing up trash and then by the time you do catch something you pretty much instantly lose it because the mechanics are so difficult , it's such a waste of energy and time .",-1
Futarias Gremory,219740,Recommended,"the only things i would have to complain about , are you get almost all weapons really early compared to how far you get into the game .",-1
huminado,238460,Recommended,it still has very minor issues in the day to day gameplay .,-1
avaster,253230,Not Recommended,"4 mechanics mechanics is an issue in this game , if beginner players are being welcomed with these unfinished mechanics then they wont interest in the game and simply get frustrated at the vanilla mechanics and leave if they wont know about mods .",-1
Fabio,219740,Recommended,pyromaniacs late game framerate drops affect flowing gameplay .,-1
b,253230,Recommended,"this didn't bother me most of the time , but there was one mechanic that really frustrated me .",-1
MVBlake,253230,Recommended,"the devs have provided a menu based tutorial helper for basic controls , as well as an opening tutorial , but it barely taps the surface of what can be done .",-1
Gordon Ramsay,253230,Recommended,the only thing that some might not like is that the camera itself can become a constant enemy .,-1
♥ Onee~Chan ♥,4000,Recommended,"but if you came for gameplay , there would not be much , so don't expect that much .",-1
Mumra,238460,Not Recommended,"i really do hope to eventually be able to change my review , what needs to change for that to happen is that the mechanics need to feel rounded out in the core game without relying on mods .",-1
Callcenter of the Void,4000,Recommended,0 gameplay .,-1
Fraggy,238460,Recommended,maybe the lines that the narrator get repetitive but still ignore that and its amazing,-1
MeNotCaring,219150,Not Recommended,a sign of low skill should not be boring gameplay when you stare at a screen a lot .,-1
Dan Schneider's Hard Drive,253230,Recommended,"the vast majority of platformers , i've found , have a tendency to treat the player like they've never played a platformer before by being excessively easy or having no sense of tight timing or awareness of gameplay mechanics in order to succeed .",-1
Thorgrax,113200,Recommended,"a weak point of this game is , that it gets repetitive .",-1
Maelstrom,219150,Recommended,"the enemy spawning level is insane , and they all follow 1 of maybe 3 different ai path finding systems , leading to zero variety .",-1
Vashek,413150,Recommended,if i had one complaint id say i dislike the time management aspect of the game but its the core mechanic and i get it .,-1
Callcenter of the Void,4000,Recommended,the next issue i have is the combat .,-1
[KwZ],4000,Recommended,beyond the third year can be very repetitive and money is not a problem anymore but i'm sure the developer is constantly working to improve that .,-1
bartuś,698780,Recommended,it's great if you don't really care about the gameplay and just want to hear a nice story .,-1
Brutal Dumbass ☢,105600,Recommended,new loot though from bosses but i had wished more exclusive loot from enemies as well or new enemies as well .,-1
:wq,219740,Recommended,"they're not very memorable in the sense that if you were to drop me in a random part of a level , i d have difficulty identifying exactly where i was .",-1
TV,219740,Recommended,"i suppose it still lacks any grind , though .",-1
Ghennkin,4000,Recommended,"i'm fine with losing to non rng situations , but not rng ones outside of my control .",-1
Exelus,219150,Not Recommended,"all of these complaints would be forgiven if the actual gameplay was fun and engaging , but it's not .",-1
Shearman360,219740,Recommended,a lot of the mechanics such as the dive and the tight ropes are ripped straight out of it .,-1
avaster,219150,Not Recommended,"1 hauling is also a bad mechanic , why do the colonists just pick up for example 1 tshirt when they can use their whole inventory 4 .",-1
Mr. Smiles,4000,Recommended,some bugs and oddities affect gameplay adversely .,-1
Mellow_Online1,253230,Recommended,"i don't mind them but a visual novel is incredibly lackluster in its gameplay as it is what it is , a visual novel .",-1
Kasdeya,294100,Recommended,"the problem is that once you press jump to location in the letter , this option disappears and you must find the enemies again by looking all over the map if you want to check the location one more time .",-1
Tiwill,253230,Recommended,"but , personally , no air control just means you get to control your character less frequently , which isn't as fun .",-1
PenguinsWillLickYou,4000,Recommended,minecraft is repetitive .,-1
emperortomato,219150,Recommended,"i played the game on a 360 pad , which generally works well , although the controls may be the game's biggest flaw .",-1
Portponky,253230,Recommended,i mean all the item effects and enemy patterns are so randomly put together that it feels badly designed and unfair almost all the time .,-1
King Link,253230,Recommended,"there are camera issues , and control issue , the jump homing attack worked about a half to a third of the time i tried it .",-1
mecklenberg,294100,Recommended,"in essence , the player is fighting the inadequacies of the combat system , rather than the system itself .",-1
Mumra,294100,Not Recommended,i'll conclude this review by listing some specific things that i think badly need addressing going through this list it becomes apparent just how nearly every single mechanic in the game feels majorly lacking .,-1
avaster,238460,Not Recommended,"do you ever get that time when you just click on a button for the colonist to do something for example : i get someone to haul a dead body or rescue a friends or something , oh wait , whats that why are they walking off i thought i assigned you to do my task this is an important issue that the devs have to compete to , and i had to go out of my way to install , yet again , a mod to replace this , for your own sake , use the achtung mod because of this game's bad mechanics to force a colonist to do a task without doing something else .",-1
WoNd3R T0A5T,219740,Recommended,another thing i didn't like about this game for the pc version was the default controls .,-1
Arcaster,238460,Recommended,"little server control and worlds that do not respawn content make for volatile multiplayer gameplay , and no progressive stats other than items make for a short lived experience .",-1
-=Zombine3D=-,219740,Recommended,Cons : A bit too short Sometimes the camera is wonky,-1
avaster,219150,Not Recommended,"7 The colonists just had a raid , they instead walk off leaving all of their dead buddies to go eat , why are they so stupid and incompetent to save their buddy themselves Instead I have to do it myself because the mechanics are not great .",-1
Docile Blemmigan,113200,Recommended,"On the face of it , dialogue can be as lackluster and repetitive as a Harvest Moon game .",-1
SquibTheDS (Been waiting a year),253230,Recommended,"The bads It crashes too often It has frame drops This : The bosses will sometimes appear in the floors so you can't hit them The game will sometimes not climb walls No alternate ending for collecting everything But the good outweighs the bad , after 2 hours in to the game I couldn't stop playing it .",-1
T.J,219150,Recommended, cons : no key mapping ( would have like to change keys ) might have to take up drugs .,-1
TV,219740,Recommended,"Cons : Game is very short Final boss fight is quite half baked Overpriced Some levels are entirely too quick to complete Online multiplayer is only unlocked by purchase of Nyakuza Metro DLC Co op is only unlocked by purchase of Seal the Deal DLC Lacks any replayability Some mechanics that are introduced at the start really aren't seen much outside of the first level Some cut content Game mechanics can be infuriating DLC is short Some points in the game feel copy pasted from other games Story is quite bland Suitability for younger audiences : Horrific segments , even for some aged players Minor suicide jokes ( In my opinion , they are not distasteful at all and are completely acceptable in the given situation ) Mild and cartoon like mischief / violence Controversy : Within a single level is a character that has almost no dialogue .",-1
Yizz,4000,Recommended,"Cons : Some of the characters are not as well written as others There are some small bugs , many of which have probably been fixed by the time of your reading this Overall , I love this game .",-1
[MM] WMan22,219740,Recommended,"it's not flawless , there are a few technical issues in the game like framedrops on alpine sky and sometimes graphics settings won't save , this game is still well worth your money as a lot of those things can be patched out and plus even the length issue will be remedied with steam workshop content that i'm sure the community is going to go wild with , or just at least recreate stuff from other platformers .",-1
Crustite,219740,Recommended,"The game also brought back some cons from old platformers like strangely placed and fixed cameras which can mess with your view and thus it makes navigating the level harder , controls sometimes can be a wee bit wonky , some rough edges when it comes to graphics and animations and a story is a bit shallow in some places .",-1
Pewt,4000,Recommended,"The graphics are very charming , and other than the interface ( which is noticeably more barebones / ugly ) do their job quite well .",-1
VTG1800,113200,Recommended,Negative : Graphics setting too low No Multiplayer invite friends to farm ( You can see Animal Crossing ) No Workshop Map not large Score : 8 .,-1
🌸HelloKittyKawaii🌸 ♡,253230,Recommended,"cons glitches some of the dialogue could have been better and they could have gotten better voice actors the game could run a little smoother the settings could have been more simplified probably not worth 30 dollars but definitely worth the 12 dollars I paid for the Humble Monthly I feel like they need to add more hats and abilities since that's kind of the main feature of the main character , her hats do special powers I really hope they keep improving this game and make it even better Cons aside , this game is worth it .",-1
HumbleMrRecker,219150,Recommended,The enemy AI can be a little weird sometimes but as a whole it was an enjoyable play with an engaging soundtrack .,-1
Luna,253230,Recommended,"When creepy stuff happens , the sound gets distorded , and game itself start to glitch .",-1
mystic,238460,Recommended,"( I'm reccomending it if you can get used to the controls and audio cut outs , other wise get it on Xbox .",-1
The CruSpader,219740,Recommended,"A Hat in Time is definitely a game I think you should give a go regardless of its length and few bugs ( doesn't harm the game much ) and I would give the soundtrack a listen at some point , before or after you play the game doesn't matter .",-1
The Red Scare,219740,Recommended,"As far as criticisms go , the voice acting has a couple misses and the camera will sometimes fight to place itself in an awkward position if left on automatic .",-1
adam,219740,Recommended,"Though this game has a well made soundtrack , great graphics , and a creative backstory , the game lacks depth because of its poorly made combat system and over the top violence .",-1
adam,238460,Recommended,"In conclusion , though this game is extremely violent and the combat / AI system is poor , I recommend playing it because of the excellent aesthetics and soundtrack the game provides .",-1
adam,219150,Recommended,"In conclusion , though this game is extremely violent and the combat / AI system is poor , I recommend playing it because of the excellent aesthetics and soundtrack the game provides .",-1
twitch.tv/epjCSGO,219150,Recommended,+ Beautiful + Great music + Fun The social aspect of the game is kinda boring .,-1
adam,238460,Recommended,"Though this game has a well made soundtrack , great graphics , and a creative backstory , the game lacks depth because of its poorly made combat system and over the top violence .",-1
dougsavage1,698780,Recommended,The graphics bore me and the mechanics seemed tedious .,-1
ErickaUnlimited,253230,Recommended,"it's wise to mention that the game can be requirement heavy for older machines , as the amount of detail , moving parts and extreme draw distances available can be very taxing to some users , but luckily the developers included full customization when it comes to graphics , as well as wonderful explanations on what each option does for those unfamiliar with certain terms .",-1
ghostspawn,219740,Recommended,"Although its gone through its array of bugs , unbalances , and old graphics thrown out , this is very well the current peak of it's development With even better to come .",-1
Diana Cavendish,253230,Recommended,"animal variety on alpha 13 , there was a bunch of animals , who increased by 6 on those patch combat system well , on 2d games , your spawns get to use covers , walls , to block enemy fire .",0
Redyn,219740,Recommended,"it was an adventure exploring the mountain peaks where each area took advantage of the mechanics and abilities , from riding across the skies using the hookshot to exploring a mystical temple using a ghostly ability from a hat found in subcon forest .",0
Mittsies,253230,Recommended,"you can just move a character behind some cover and let them fire away , or control their every action and micromanage them like you would in a real time strategy .",0
OmegaConstruct,219740,Recommended,this isn't a fps where you start it on the heroic difficulty the first time you play it because you're good at shooters .,0
Blitz,219150,Recommended,"you make the decisions to equip , shelter , feed , and protect your colony from the environmental dangers and enemy factions .",0
Exelus,219150,Not Recommended,"there are a lot of examples of mood modifiers being outside of player control , this is just the most obvious one i've found .",0
The Large Mountain Jew,698780,Recommended,"inbetween creating the best farm known to man , you can also play as a lumberjack , go fishing in an infuriating at times fishing mechanic , and kill monsters in your friendly neighborhood rpg dungeon .",0
Oscar,219740,Recommended,the gameplay is just like any other vn where one goes through dialogues with choices in between which decide the course of the game .,0
InsolentDreams,253230,Recommended,"my two main gunmen were recovering from injury from some raging animals and could not fight , only to get raided from enemies .",0
BrainCR4MP,253230,Recommended,and oh loord how it is deep in gameplay .,0
Mittsies,294100,Recommended,"as gameplay updates comes out and modders get more creative , i imagine there will be more goals as well .",0
Mittsies,253230,Recommended,"you don't control your colonists directly ( except during combat ) , but rather provide jobs for them to do and you set up what jobs each colonist is allowed to do in the work tab .",0
Orpheolus,105600,Recommended,hardmode itself on a good player is not that bad just the difficulty spike is not the best for most players and how brutal the endgame can be .,0

Blitz,4000,Recommended,my suggestion to this is to play the game on a reduced difficulty and learn from your mistakes .,0
OblivionPenguin,219150,Recommended,"while this is true of some of the earlier skirmishes , your beginners luck can quickly turn on you when you face higher numbers of enemies with more developed weapons .",0
The Fattest Nut,219740,Recommended,"the only downside to having so much content is the amount of time spend looking on the wiki for help , and the amount of downtime mining and farming enemies between bosses .",0
Orpheolus,238460,Recommended,this difficulty spike is a major downside and if you don't have friends to play with these times will be very hard even when the end of hardmode does come around with the best of stuff you are still at the disadvantage .,0
lummis,698780,Recommended,"yet it is very similar because of the gameplay and everything being composed of blocks that can be mined , moved and placed etc .",0
Honey Badger,238460,Recommended,"you're not completely alone however , you do have a gentle tribe and a gentle outlander faction that are neutral , but give them gifts and they will become allies , they will send trade caravans to trade items , from exotic wonders to deadly weapons that can annihilate large groups of people , and make them your allies and they will even come to help you fight off raiders , whether you request them to help you out or they willingly surprise you with reinforcements , you will be more than glad to have them by your side .",0
Porcupine,253230,Not Recommended,"updates are typically filled with what are technically minor achievements , without significantly touching the core gameplay oh , i added a new mental break for your pawns , same mechanic , but this action targets x instead of y ) .",0

SadcatIce,219740,Recommended,adding in weapons is always fun .,0
Lunchmuny,219150,Recommended,it could also be a nightmarish hellscape of difficulty that leaves you questioning your sanity as each and every one of your colonists desperately clings to the last remnants of their fleeting hope while snorting yayo to numb the pain of their missing eye .,0
NoOne,294100,Recommended,"finally , my last gripe is that when playing it over and over , over coming hte struggles and problems that face early on makes each game fun and lasting , but when you get to the time of self sufficiant , decemating all enemies within seconds , and being increadably rich , gets boring and nearly all games i had ended up like that .",0
