Some considerations:

Atmosphere = Music/Soundtrack + Visuals
Interface/HUD/UI is different from Graphics
The word "beautiful" doesn't always refer to visuals
isPositive is based solely on the category getting evaluated WITHOUT any regard to the other comments
Cost is considered as a different category like when the reviewer talks about the story of the game
Receiving a mediocre rating is considered as good for indie games but bad for AAA games *with reservations
Diversity is good.
RNG can be seen as both good and bad. 

Ambiguous reviews will be considered INVALID.
