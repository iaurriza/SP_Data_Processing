Energonchi,219740,Recommended,"Doki Doki Literature Club on Steam is a videogame featuring a different experience a freaky bold agony start of creepy laidback glitches and frequency's of what the hell common deja vu is going on Its a visual novel with movement , sprinting with struggling attempts but it delivers the right notes of getting you splintered in the controllable set mind It may suffer some dialogue and story bits but the characters are cute and well dressed to fit the part of being unrealistic and side stepped beautiful looking A great pleasure radiated with sharp sciatic pain that is both acknowledgable with ibuprofen relief A backstory of these girls showing their horror side and obsessive minds like the star is swifting you into bloody madness I literally need to take counter medication after playing this game and beating it till the game just deletes itself spoilers alert A step class this game sets whole cardio and a good breakfast line of being interesting and ruthlessly original in some flowing parts Great graphic presentation , great ost soundtrack with a few top headoff tunes that are quivering and both shining into a stardom gaze of satisfaction Its like talking to hot girls that are now into you whatever who u are female or male and it guides you into an aftermath of bringing 6 hours of gloomy appreciation It teaches you a throne of finding out things and a mystery to alot of gamers Are you secretly anxious , then play this game now cause the best part its enhancing free no extra cost unless u buy the dlc pack which features more goodies and thats 10 bucks Its both consulting and functioning to make this game a charming blast to find out next is what stored for us novel readers and gamers I really recommend this game and it should be played at least a couple of times to withstand all the double edgy imagery and furnishing dialogue I give this game a 9 .",1
ErickaUnlimited,253230,Recommended,"it's wise to mention that the game can be requirement heavy for older machines , as the amount of detail , moving parts and extreme draw distances available can be very taxing to some users , but luckily the developers included full customization when it comes to graphics , as well as wonderful explanations on what each option does for those unfamiliar with certain terms .",1

Exuma,253230,Recommended,"Not a single track feels out of place and every piece shapes the 80's atmosphere very well ( give my props to'm O O N , Perturbator and Sun Araw , they really know how to make music ) .",1

Fnordy,219740,Recommended,"Aren't you the cutest thing ever Great game , really great to play a bit on the easy side and on the short side , sure mods can fix those things but still , HatKid is really easy to control , the worlds are great , the graphics aren't expectacular but since it's a cartoonish game the art style make it up , also , the most important , HATS ( good score ) would pay full prize for a sequel",1
